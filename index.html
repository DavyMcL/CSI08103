                <h2>Logo Redesign</h2>
                <p>With the new logo, I wanted to keep the aesthetic message that came from the original logo whilst
                    incorporating a more tech theme around that original design. I built the new logo around the plant
                    being the centerpiece of the logo and encased it in a location pin that is commonly seen on Google
                    Maps - then I wrapped the logo with the purple borders to make it feel more organic.</p>
                <img src="Eco Tech (draft).png" alt="">
                <p>When creating the design, I wanted to find a way to make it feel less blocky and pointed, and wanted
                    to find ways to make it feel more organic, which is better fitting for EcoTech. I started with the
                    idea of thinking of purple borders to be like a thumb that is grabbing the plant and plucking it -
                    which is the reason the location pin design isn't pointed to give that organic feeling.</p>

            <article id="persona">
                <h2>User Persona</h2>
                <p>In crafting the user persona for EcoTech, the primary focus was on capturing the essence of the
                    general consumer interested in eco-friendly products and inclined towards purchasing from companies
                    like EcoTech. Central to this process was an assessment of the individual's existing knowledge and
                    its potential impact on their interaction with EcoTech. It became evident that the user's overall
                    experience would heavily hinge on the availability and accessibility of information regarding
                    EcoTech's products.</p>
                <img src="User Persona.png" alt="">
                <p>Identifying the core needs and frustrations of the user was crucial, with a significant frustration
                    stemming from the lack of comprehensive information or understanding about EcoTech's offerings.
                    Despite this potential hurdle, there existed a strong inclination among users to patronize EcoTech
                    and make purchases from the company.</p>
                <p>Understanding that users were willing to invest time and effort in learning more about EcoTech, it
                    became imperative to ensure that information was easily accessible and readily available. Any
                    barriers to accessing information, such as requiring payment or navigating through complex
                    processes, could deter users from engaging further with EcoTech. Therefore, the primary focus in
                    developing the user persona was on facilitating easy and convenient access to information,
                    recognizing that seamless access to unfamiliar territory was essential for fostering user engagement
                    and satisfaction.</p>

                <h2>User Journey</h2>
                <p>The development of the user persona for EcoTech was centered on understanding the needs and
                    preferences of the general consumer interested in eco-friendly products. In crafting the user
                    persona, I carefully considered the level of information available to individuals and how it
                    influenced their experience with EcoTech. It became evident that a lack of accessible information
                    and understanding of the products could lead to frustration among users. However, despite this
                    potential barrier, there existed a strong desire among consumers to make purchases from EcoTech.</p>
                <img src="Expectations.png" alt="">
                <img src="scenario Concept.png" alt="">
                <p>Recognizing the importance of ease of access to information, I focused on ensuring that relevant
                    information was readily available and easily accessible to users. This approach aimed to address
                    users' frustrations and facilitate a seamless browsing and purchasing experience.</p>
                <p>
                    As part of the user journey development, I began by outlining a sequence of key points to serve as a
                    foundation for the user's interaction with EcoTech's website:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discovery: Users arrive at EcoTech's website.</li>
                    <li>Exploration: Users navigate the website to find specific informatio</li>
                    <li>Information sourcing: Users seek relevant information, assessing its accessibility on EcoTech's
                        site.</li>
                    <li>Consideration: Users build confidence and comfort with potential purchases.</li>
                    <li>Conversion: Users engage with EcoTech to make a purchase.</li>
                    <li>Post-purchase experience: Users experience the follow-up process and assess its impact.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="User Journey.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    Expanding upon these key points, I developed a detailed user journey diagram that accurately
                    depicted the anticipated interactions and experiences of users as they engaged with EcoTech's
                    website. This comprehensive approach ensured that the user journey effectively catered to the needs
                    and expectations of the identified user persona, fostering a positive and seamless user experience.

                <h2>Site Mapping and Designs</h2>
                <p>The initial phase of site mapping and design began with the creation of a rough blueprint outlining
                    the site's architecture, emphasizing core functionalities and content. Subsequently, an initial
                    sitemap was developed, followed by the creation of a basic wireframe to conceptualize the layout and
                    flow of the homepage.</p>
                <img src="wireframe - draft.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    However, upon the creation of the wireframe, it became evident that the chosen color scheme posed
                    challenges and felt disjointed, hindering further progress. This prompted a reevaluation of the
                    design aesthetics to ensure cohesion and visual appeal.
                </p>
                <img src="Homepage -draft.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    After several iterations, the color scheme was revamped to achieve a bolder and more impactful look.
                    The new palette exuded a sense of professionalism and sophistication, prompting an expansion of the
                    site's taxonomy to better align with the refined visual direction.
                    Utilizing the updated taxonomy provided deeper insights into the content structure, facilitating the
                    creation of a more refined sitemap. This holistic approach significantly enhanced the logical flow
                    and organization of content on the homepage, resulting in a more cohesive and user-friendly design.

                <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
                <p>Phase One: Audit and Analysis</p>
                <p>Our trip began with a thorough examination of EcoTech's content landscape. I gained crucial insights
                    about our emerging content domain after conducting a thorough assessment. By recognizing both
                    strengths and places for growth, I established the framework for a strategy that was highly
                    responsive to the demands of our audience.

                <p>
                    Phase two: Development and Structure
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began the development phase armed with the audit's observations. I used a disciplined approach to
                    content development, led by well-defined calendars for short and medium-form material. These
                    calendars functioned as our compass, delivering a consistent flow of relevant and engaging content
                    across all of our channels.

                <p>
                    But our adventure wasn't done. Recognizing the power of alternative media, I went into unknown
                    territory, embracing podcasts, interactive tools, and other novel formats. These additions not only
                    would widen our horizons but also increase our connection to our community, resulting in a more
                    informed and loyal following.
